# Benchmark results Results for Encoding


[The latest results are here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/gaspardpetit/base64/294fac8a0e679cbe72f0a3d6f40e1a3bccba7c5d/result/result.html)

# base64

Searching the web for a C/C++ base64 implementation yields many results.
 
 
How does one chose?
This project aims at collecting and comparing the different implementations available.
 
Feel free to improve this test or to submit new implementations! 

### Disclaimer

Keep in mind that some implementations were slightly modified to have a common interface for the test framework.  In all cases, line breaks were omitted both for encoding and parsing. Also, although all implementations have been unit-tested, no analysis whatsoever has been made on error handling, so some slower implementation may actually be better at reporting malformed base64 strings for instance.

I do not own any of these implementations - make sure you check their respective license before using them.

## Conclusion

- If you want the fastest implementation, [Turbo-Base64](https://github.com/powturbo/Turbo-Base64) (GPL-3.0) is the fastest. Slightly behind, and with more permissive licenses, [simdutf](https://github.com/simdutf/simdutf) (MIT License) and [base64 (Alfred Klomp)](https://github.com/aklomp/base64) (BSD-2 License) are both great alternatives.
- If you want a simple single-header c++ file with good performance, go for [base64 (Tobias Locker)](https://github.com/tvercaut/base64)
- Some other implementations are terrible, the slower ones generally allocate memory dynamically as they convert, even though the output size is deterministic and can be preallocated;
- libb64 shows very strange performance results - I get the feeling that they are doing something neat but that I am perhaps not using their code right;
- A lot of implementations are available, everyone claims theirs is better. This test shows that unless you measure, you cannot make any claims about the performance of your code;

Keep in mind that these results were all obtained using a specific compiler and could differ on another compiler.
